# Bootstrap OSX
- OSX uses homebrew most of the time. So the script will have to install homebrew first.
- Some programming languages are already installed out-of-the-box.

```
# install homebrew
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

# dependency packages
brew install maven
brew install gradle
brew install yarn
brew install node

# databases
brew install mysql
brew install rabbitmq
brew install reddis

# others
brew install visual-studio-code
brew install git
```
